# Hello_World

My first repository on GitHub 

Maximilia here. I am an undergrad, double majoring in Business Analytics & Business Economics, with passion for programmming and data mining. 
I love :R&B music:, :art:, and :coffee:. 
I am hoping to strenghten my programming skills with the  help of skilled programmers like you, and with Github to back up my codes.
